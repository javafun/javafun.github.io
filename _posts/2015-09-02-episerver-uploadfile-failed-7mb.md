One of the client recently encountered this issue with EPiServer CMS.


Itâ€™s very frastructing issue, my workmates spent lots of time looking from the EPiServer side, this is our perception as EPiServer had more bugs than Microsoft. However, this time we are wrong ðŸ™‚

Thanks for all my workmates hard work.
