One of my colleagues asked me how to create a read-only user for a particular database in Azure SQL, I thought it would be similar process as how I did in SQL server. As it turned out, it wasn't really straightforward. I decide to share my learning in this blog post.  
<!--more-->

## Step 1

Run the following scripts to create user (1st script) and grant db (2nd script)

```sql

CREATE USER [yourusername] WITH PASSWORD = 'strong password';

```

```sql
ALTER ROLE [db_datareader] ADD MEMBER [yourusername];
```

## Step 2

Open your SQL Management Studio (SSMS). Fill the login details with the username/password created above, click on **Options** and enter the database name.

> NOTES: You must always specify the database name as the user created with step 1 SQL script is using [Contained Database User Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/contained-database-users-making-your-database-portable?view=sql-server-ver15)
