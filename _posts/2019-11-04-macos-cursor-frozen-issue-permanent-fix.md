## Symptom
Your Mac cursor would either freeze/become unresponsive/disappear totally when you launch an app.

Your cursor size could be changed to other size than `normal`

2. Choose `Accessibility`, then select `Display`
3. Navigate to `Cursor size` bar on the right pane, and change it to `normal`
