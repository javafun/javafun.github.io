I finally completed the setup and upgrade for my new toy this Monday - `Dell Alienware M15 R5`. This is my second personal Windows laptop after a decade with Mac.

My last Windows laptop is Dell XPS, which is 10+ years old. It's still healthy and providing enough power for our cousin to complete daily work. I've been always fascinated by the RGB colorful laptop especially with Dell Alienware, so I decide to give it a try. 


## Install additional SSD
After some research, I found the SN750 seemed the most power efficient Gen 3 NVMe drive. In addition, the Alienware M15 motherboard limited Gen4 to Gen3 bandwidth, I decide to get WD SN750 1TB Gen 3 NVMe instead. 

I was a bit worried before I recieved the laptop as I've read from internet some people laptops (M15) don't have bracket and heat shield. Fortunately, my one has everything included.

The installation seems pretty intuitive. All I need to do is to unscrew the heat shield, insert the drive in then put the shield back, less than 5 mins job, nice and easy.

## RAM

32GB RAM is my standard configuration nowadays. This is one of reasons I move back to Windows laptop as it's too costly to get 32GB RAM version of MacBook Pro. This model comes with 16GB RAM by default, it only takes a few minutes to upgrade to 32GB :)

## Final

I'm really happy with this new toy after the upgrade, and I really appreciate how easy the upgrade Dell is made for their customers.



Happy Coding! ðŸ˜‡
