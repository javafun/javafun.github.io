![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-training.png)
## Prerequisite
* Azure account
* TFS 2017 (Trial)
* SQL Server 2012 and above (SQL Express is fine for demo and self play)
* Domain Name (there are many free domain register provider nowadays, see more details later)

### Step 1 â€“ Spin up VM

Sign up a free Azure account, then spin up a VM with Windows 2016 Data Centre image

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/34969508150_b06bed80f1_b.jpg)

### Step 2 â€“ Configure NSG (Network Security Group)

Make sure you add both HTTP and HTTPS in the _Inbound security rules_, so we can later access from external.

### Step 3 â€“ SQL Server and TFS Installation


Download SQL Server 2016 Express installer (5MB) from the link below, then follow the instruction and install with default settings.

[sql server 2016 express]https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads

Download TFS 2017 installer (2MB) from the link below, then follow the instruction and install with default settings

[tfs 2017] https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/tfs2017-relnotes

By default, TFS will be running on port 8080. In this example, my TFS web url is

http://tfsdemo:8080/tfs

Open you your TFS site in IE, make sure you can see the TFS homepage 


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/34515273894_5cc6b5408b_b.jpg)


### Step 4 â€“ Register a free domain name

In this step, weâ€™ll register a DNS, and in the next few steps we can configure the TFS to be accessible from external.

After a quick search, I found http://www.freenom.com/ that seems good enough and satisfy me need, so I registered a few free domain names from this site. Registration process is quite straightforward and only took me a few minutes to get my free domain name. ðŸ™‚

Once you logged in to the site, you can access to your domain management from Services menu.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/34547463483_ea1d7d9213_b.jpg)


Before set up your DNS, you will need to get the virtual machine public IP from Azure portal


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/35358685615_415939d95b_b.jpg)


In the DNS management screen, put the public IP in the target for A record.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/35317866766_98b3a59c1e_b.jpg)

### Step 5 â€“ Bind the domain name on TFS site

Open the IIS, first disable the Default Website,then locate to Team Foundation Server site, add a new binding

Port: 80

Host Name:  <The one your registered in step 4>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/35358386405_391ed32d47_b.jpg)


### Step 6 â€“ Update the TFS public url

You can change the TFS public url via TFS Admin console.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tfs-play/35358354835_e490f33ee1_b.jpg)


> TIPS: If you try to test the new public url from TFS server, you will be prompted to enter username and password, but I couldnâ€™t manage to log in successfully. I canâ€™t figure out what caused this.  If you want to access the TFS on its server, youâ€™ll need to continue using your the local url with port 8080.


Congratulation, you have completed everything, and your TFS server is now publicly available.

Itâ€™s a tough day, but finally I get it working ðŸ™‚ Hopefully, this might help you.
