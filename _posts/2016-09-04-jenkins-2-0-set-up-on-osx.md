## Prerequisite

- JAVA JDK 7 or above
- GIT
- MAVEN 3 or above

## Install Jenkins

- Install jenkins via homebrew
- brew update &amp;&amp; brew install jenkins

## Starting Jenkins

After Jenkins is installed successfully, follow the instructions to start Jenkins on login

```bash
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/jenkins/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

If you want to configure Jenkins to launch on system startup, for all users on OS X, then copy the plist file to the system Launchd location instead

```bash

sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/jenkins/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons

sudo chown `whoami` /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist

```

You can always start Jenkins manually with

```bash
/usr/local/bin/jenkins
```

or if you have set up your PATH correctly when installing Homebrew, simply

```bash
jenkins
```

## Starting Jenkins as service

#### Start service

```
brew services start jenkins
```

#### Stop service

```
brew services stop jenkins
```

#### Restart service

```
brew services restart jenkins
```

## Restarting Jenkins

If you have an older version of Jenkins and you are upgrading it, then you can restart it this way:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist
```

Git intallation should be picked up by default, unless you install GIT after Jekins.

[Maven doesnâ€™t have a â€˜libâ€™ subdirectory in Jenkins](http://flummox-engineering.blogspot.com/2016/01/maven-doesnt-have-a-lib-subdirectory-jenkins.html)

_Solution:_

> The â€˜libâ€™ folder should be linking to libexec subdirectory.
> If you install your maven via homebrew, your maven home should /usr/local/opt/maven31/libexec. (Note: maven31 is the version I installed on my mac, change this according to your local setting.)
