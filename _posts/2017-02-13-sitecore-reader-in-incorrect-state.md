My demo app came up with this issue after making some changes to patch config file today.

Sitecore.Xml.Patch.XmlReaderSource..ctor(XmlReader reader, String sourceName) +123
Sitecore.Configuration.ConfigPatcher.GetXmlElement(XmlReader reader, String sourceName) +45
Sitecore.Configuration.ConfigPatcher.ApplyPatch(TextReader patch, String sourceName) +138
Sitecore.Configuration.ConfigPatcher.ApplyPatch(String filename) +93
Sitecore.Configuration.ConfigReader.LoadAutoIncludeFiles(ConfigPatcher patcher, String folder) +177


This is a weird issue at the first glance, I still have no idea what happened under the hood, though I solved the problem.

## Cause
<span style="color:red">**I accidentally added a comment in my patch config which is in between and section, this is the fundamental cause.**</span>

## Solution
To fix this YSOD, simply move the comment anywhere within section.

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜‡
