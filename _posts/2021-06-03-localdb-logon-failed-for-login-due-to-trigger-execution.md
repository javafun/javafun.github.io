I encountered an issue - `Logon failed for login 'xx\xxx' due to trigger execution` today when I tested my local site. I expanded details from SSMS to investigate with no luck. I tried to re-install SQL 2019 localdb, reverted back to old version of localdb, none of them fixed my issue.

## Fixes

After spending nearly an hour on this issue, I concluded my localdb `MSSQLLocaldb` was corrupted. I decided to delete and re-create `MSSQLLocaldb` to see if it works. Luckily, this approach fixed my issue.

### Step 1 - Delete `MSSQLLocaldb` folder

The folder can be found from the location below.

```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Instances
```

### Step 2 - Re-create `MSSQLLocaldb` database

Run the following command from your terminal

```
sqllocaldb create MSSQLLocaldb

```
