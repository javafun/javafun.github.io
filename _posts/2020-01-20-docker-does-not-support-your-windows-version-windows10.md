Today, I receive an update after start docker on my laptop. After update finish, I encounter `Docker doesn't support your windows version. Check documentation for minimum requirements` error.

## Causes
After search on the internet, I found other people had the same issue after update to latest docker client and raised on [docker-for-win](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4482). The current issue status has been marked closed, however I don't see any pull request link to address this issue. Luckily, I found the workaround by going through the discussion in the thread. 

The root cause of this issue is my machine `PSModulePath` environment variable got messed up. The entry for `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules` was replaced with text `System.String[]`

## Fixes
The fix is very simple. Open *Environment variables*, edit `PSModulePath` variable under *System variables* section and replace `System.String[]` to `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules`.

Launch docker from start menu, my docker is back and running. Hooray!!
