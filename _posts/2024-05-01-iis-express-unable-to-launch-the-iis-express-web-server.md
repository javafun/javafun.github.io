Nowadays, I don't quite often use IIS express web server for web development since I move to .NET core and Kestrel becomes my favourite local development server. However, when I need to support legacy customers solution, I prefer choose IIS express first before moving to IIS server. I barely have issue with IIS express except this annoying one randomly happened and it always takes me decent amount of time to get everything working again. 


<!--more-->
In this blog post, I decide to document one of the root cause for this issue I encountered and the fix, so I don't have to spend more than a few minutes whenever I encounter this issue again. 

## Symptom

```
---------------------------
Microsoft Visual Studio
---------------------------
Unable to launch the IIS Express Web server.

Failed to register URL "http://localhost:xxxx/" for site "xxxxxx" application
"/". Error description: The process cannot access the file because it is being
used by another process. (0x80070020)

---------------------------
OK   
---------------------------
```

## Causes
According to my research, it looks like many ports are restricted/reserved to access on Windows machines on some Windows updates or applications

You can use the following command to list the reserved ranges.

```bat
netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
```

If you find the port configured in Visual Studio listed in above command, it means the port is not available for use by IIS express. 

## Fixes

The fix would be much easier once the root cause has been identified. 

There are two solutions and both of them works fine me. 

### Solution 1

Change to different port that are not in the reserved ranges

### Solution 2

Run the following command

1. Stop `winnat`
```bat
net stop winnat
```
2. Start your web application
3. Start `winnat`
```bat
net start winnat
```
I hope you find this blog post helpul and get your development environment back to normal quicker.
