I had this issue back to 3 years ago when I helped client to implement B2C Commerce solution on Episerver Commerce 9. I almost forget this until I hit on this issue again while preparing my Episerver Commerce certification exam recently. So I decide to write a quick blog post to share my solution.


## Packages to be installed

* `Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory`
* `Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault`



Happy Coding! ðŸ˜‡
