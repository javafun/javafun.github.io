> In order to get form submitted correctly along with uploaded file(s), your solution **MUST** have at least one [media type](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/content-management-system/docs/media-types-and-templates){:target="_blank"} defines a list of file extensions and the allowed extensions you specified in the fileupload element **MUST** exist in the media type file extenion list.

The following code snipet is an example of media type definition.

```csharp
[ContentType(DisplayName = "FormUploadFile", GUID = "7BD7FA9F-F1B5-42D8-B4CA-444426E162CB", Description = "")]
[MediaDescriptor(ExtensionString = "pdf,doc,docx,txt")]
public class FormUploadFile : MediaData
{

}
```
