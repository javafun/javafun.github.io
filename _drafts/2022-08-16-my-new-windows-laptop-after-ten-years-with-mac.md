This Monday, I finally completed the setup and upgrade for my new toy. This is my second personal Windows laptop after 10 years with Mac. 

<!--more-->

My first personal Windows laptop is Dell XPS, which is 10+ years old. It still services enough for our cousin. It's a bit hard decision to go back to Windows laptop again after being on Mac for very long time. 

I've been always been always fascinated by the RGB colorful laptop especially with Dell Alienware. 


## Install additional SSD
After some research, I found the SN750 seemed the most power efficient Gen 3 NVMe drive. In addition, the Alienware M15 motherboard limited Gen4 to Gen3 bandwidth, I decide to get WD SN750 1TB Gen 3 NVMe instead. 

I was a bit worried before I recieved the laptop as I've read from internet some people laptops (M15) don't have bracket and heat shield. Fortunately, my one has everything included.

The installation seems pretty intuitive. All I need to do is to unscrew the heat shield, insert the drive in then put the shield back, less than 5 mins job, nice and easy.
